## About Me

I am a PhD student, currently affiliated with the Computer Vision Group at the University of Bonn, Germany. I am supervised by [Professor Dr. JÃ¼rgen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/), and am working in the domain of Long-Term Video Recognition and Anticipation.

Previously I was a researcher in computer vision, affiliated with the [Intelligent Visual Analytics Lab (IVAL)](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/){:target="_blank"} at the [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/){:target="_blank"}. I was supervised by [Dr. Salman Khan](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=M59O9lkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

I completed my master's degree in [Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV)](http://ipcv.eu/){:target="_blank"} funded by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree (EMJMD) scholarship program. During the master's program, I was fortunate to have interned at  the [Empathic Computing Lab](http://empathiccomputing.org/){:target="_blank"} supervised by [Dr. Mark Billinghurst](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-J_ItYAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. I completed my [master's thesis](assets/files/msc_thesis_wasim_syedtalal.pdf){:target="_blank"} in the [CVLAB](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/){:target="_blank"} at EPFL supervised by [Dr. Mathieu Salzmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n-B0jr4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}.

I hold an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in computer science, from [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/){:target="_blank"} in Karachi, Paksitan.
